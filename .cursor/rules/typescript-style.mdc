- TS strict everywhere; avoid `any` at all costs (only at unavoidable boundaries).
- Exported/public functions and interfaces must be explicitly typed.
- Naming:
  - Variables/functions: camelCase
  - Types/components: PascalCase
  - Folders: kebab-case
- Control flow: prefer early returns; avoid deep nesting (>2â€“3 levels).
- Keep functions focused; extract helpers instead of long bodies.
