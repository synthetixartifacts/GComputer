- Use `@ts/i18n/service.initI18n(locale)` during app init to seed catalogs (`en.json`, `fr.json`).
- Use `@ts/i18n/store.t` in Svelte: subscribe explicitly and unsubscribe on destroy.
- Change language via `@features/settings/service.setLocale(locale)` which updates both settings and i18n store.
- Keys are dot-notated; missing keys fallback to English or key string.
