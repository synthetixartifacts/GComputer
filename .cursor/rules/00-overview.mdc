Title: Repo overview for agents

Summary: High-signal constraints for this repository.

Rules:
- Use path aliases: `@renderer/*`, `@views/*`, `@ts/*`, `@features/*`, `@components/*`.
- Views are thin Svelte files. Put logic into feature `service.ts` and `store.ts` files.
- Do not import Node/Electron in renderer views or TS. Use preload-exposed IPC only.
- TS strict. Avoid `any`.
- Styling must follow `01-styles.mdc`.
