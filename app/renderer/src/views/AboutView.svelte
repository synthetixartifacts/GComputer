      GComputer is an Electron + Svelte desktop app. This page will contain information about the
      application, its purpose, and links to documentation.

      For now, this is placeholder text. Navigation is handled via hash-based routes, and pages are
      shown one at a time. Header and footer are always present; the menu contains links to navigate
      between pages under Settings â†’ About.
