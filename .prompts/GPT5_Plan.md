Im looking to create the perfect style guide page with everything on it that we will use for the project.

Have a look under our menu test>styleguide what already exist, how everything is working.

All item should like only be styling or reusable component, if thats not the case we have to fix it.

I want to keep the styleguide into multiple section like that so its eady to find things and understand and test it works for me.
Validate in each sub page what there is, that everything is cleanly coded and resusable for later on in different section. Also take a little bit of time to think about if that section is missing an element that should be in it while still having an overview of whats on the others section.

Think about this, make your master plan clearly setup and then go on and execute while always making sure what you do is clean and lean.

For your execution you will create a CURRENT_PLAN.md with all you plan steps well defined. All clearly setup for you to later iterate. Really this time you will only think about creating your perfect plan in that file well segmeneted with clear indicator that its a step by step with uncheck yet item.

Once you created that plan you will execute one task at a time. ONE AT A TIME, then check it the telling yourself to go to the next one, one at a time.

I want to add the record voice component in test/styleguide/record new page/element.

Styleguide again are supposed to be create as element of reusable component for the whole website.
Make sure the element record itself is a reusable configurable component.
Lets create a fake record page where we can see and test basic record reusable record component
In this page we will see a button record, a big icon record button,  a simple icon button reccord
All of these will simply for this page open and record the mic audio of the user.
Everything is like configurable for better scalability, all important settings are open with default values. Think about tthis.

Once we upload / save the audio there a possible way for each element to just play back the audio we received but also cancel or/and rerecord another audio.

Each possible trigger got its own ux/ui. think about it
