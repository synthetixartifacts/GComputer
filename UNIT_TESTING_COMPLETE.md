  - Tests settings persistence and atomic file writing
  - Validates settings migration and validation
  - Tests locale and theme mode validation
  - Ensures proper error handling and defaults
  - Tests concurrent access and caching
  - Coverage: All settings operations

#### IPC Communication (Critical Infrastructure)
- **`app/main/db/handlers/__tests__/admin-handlers.test.ts`**
  - Tests all IPC handlers for admin operations
  - Validates provider, model, and agent CRUD via IPC
  - Tests error propagation and data type handling
  - Ensures proper service integration
  - Coverage: Complete IPC admin interface

#### Router System (Critical Navigation)
- **`app/renderer/src/ts/features/router/__tests__/service.test.ts`**
  - Tests navigation and hash change handling
  - Validates route normalization and legacy aliases
  - Tests browser history integration
  - Ensures proper fallback for unknown routes
  - Tests concurrent navigation and edge cases
  - Coverage: Complete routing functionality

### 3. **Documentation & Guidelines**

#### Moved to Proper Structure
- **`docs/testing-plan.md`** - Comprehensive testing strategy
- **`docs/howto/testing.md`** - Implementation guide with examples

#### Updated CLAUDE.md
- Added testing guidelines for when to run tests
- **MANDATORY for major changes**: Architecture changes, new features, database schema changes, IPC modifications
- **OPTIONAL for minor changes**: Bug fixes, styling updates, documentation changes
- Test commands and coverage requirements

### 4. **Package Configuration**

#### Root Package Scripts
```json
"test": "vitest",
"test:ui": "vitest --ui", 
"test:run": "vitest run",
"test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage",

"test:main": "vitest run app/main",
"test:renderer": "vitest run app/renderer", 
"test:db": "npm --workspace @gcomputer/db run test"
```

#### Workspace Package Scripts
- Added test script to `packages/db/package.json`
