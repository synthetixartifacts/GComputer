# CURRENT ANALYSIS & DOCUMENTATION PLAN

## Objective

Conduct comprehensive analysis of the GComputer codebase to create authoritative documentation, validate existing docs against implementation, and provide recommendations for the scalable "everything app" vision.

## Context

- App is at UX/UI foundation stage with reusable component architecture
- Vision: Single app abstraction layer over OS, filesystem, internet
- Future: Vocal interaction, computer control agents, vision capabilities
- Current: Component library, routing, i18n, theming, database foundation

## Execution Protocol

- Execute ONE task at a time, in sequence
- Mark complete before moving to next
- Validate findings against actual code
- Maintain comprehensive DOC.md throughout

---

## Phase 1: Deep Code Analysis

- [ ] **1.1** - Analyze project structure vs documented structure
  - Compare actual file tree with docs/architecture.md
  - Identify new files, moved files, changed patterns
  - Document current vs expected structure

- [ ] **1.2** - Validate .cursor rules against actual implementation
  - Check if code follows stated conventions
  - Identify violations or outdated rules
  - Document current coding patterns in use

- [ ] **1.3** - Examine feature architecture implementation
  - Analyze actual feature folder structure
  - Document service/store patterns in use
  - Check consistency across features

- [ ] **1.4** - Validate component architecture
  - Catalog all components and their APIs
  - Document reusable patterns
  - Check component composition in views

---

## Phase 2: Documentation Validation

- [ ] **2.1** - Cross-reference docs/README.md with current state
  - Check if links are current
  - Validate described features
  - Document gaps or outdated info

- [ ] **2.2** - Validate docs/architecture.md accuracy
  - Compare described architecture with implementation
  - Check process descriptions (main/preload/renderer)
  - Document architectural evolution

- [ ] **2.3** - Check docs/conventions.md vs actual practices
  - Validate naming conventions in codebase
  - Check TypeScript usage patterns
  - Document style patterns actually used

- [ ] **2.4** - Validate docs/howto/* guides
  - Test installation steps accuracy
  - Check run commands work
  - Validate component usage examples

---

## Phase 3: Implementation Deep Dive

- [ ] **3.1** - Analyze Electron architecture implementation
  - Document main process capabilities
  - Catalog preload API surface
  - Check security model implementation

- [ ] **3.2** - Examine database integration
  - Document current schema
  - Check migration system
  - Analyze IPC database patterns

- [ ] **3.3** - Study i18n implementation
  - Check localization coverage
  - Document key management
  - Validate English/French completeness

- [ ] **3.4** - Analyze routing and navigation
  - Document current route structure
  - Check dev/prod gating
  - Validate navigation patterns

---

## Phase 4: Component System Analysis

- [ ] **4.1** - Catalog all UI components
  - Document component APIs
  - Check reusability patterns
  - Identify component gaps

- [ ] **4.2** - Analyze view composition patterns
  - Document how views use components
  - Check for code duplication
  - Validate thin view principle

- [ ] **4.3** - Study styling architecture
  - Document SCSS organization
  - Check theming implementation
  - Validate no-styles-in-Svelte rule

---

## Phase 5: Build System & Dependencies

- [ ] **5.1** - Analyze build configuration
  - Document Vite/esbuild setup
  - Check path aliases implementation
  - Validate development workflow

- [ ] **5.2** - Examine dependency usage
  - Document key dependencies and their usage
  - Check for unused dependencies
  - Analyze workspace structure

- [ ] **5.3** - Validate development commands
  - Test all npm scripts
  - Document development workflow
  - Check hot reload behavior

---

## Phase 6: Future Vision Alignment

- [ ] **6.1** - Assess architecture scalability
  - Evaluate component reusability for "everything app"
  - Check patterns for future features
  - Document extensibility points

- [ ] **6.2** - Analyze current feature foundations
  - Document existing file/search infrastructure
  - Check database schema for future needs
  - Evaluate IPC patterns for expansion

---

## Phase 7: Master Documentation Creation

- [ ] **7.1** - Create comprehensive DOC.md
  - Consolidate all findings
  - Document current reality vs docs
  - Create single source of truth

- [ ] **7.2** - Update existing docs based on findings
  - Refresh outdated sections
  - Add missing information
  - Fix broken references

- [ ] **7.3** - Create TODO.md with recommendations
  - List improvement opportunities
  - Suggest architectural refinements
  - Prioritize recommendations

---

## Phase 8: Validation & Quality Check

- [ ] **8.1** - Run comprehensive testing
  - Execute npm run typecheck
  - Test npm run build
  - Validate npm run dev

- [ ] **8.2** - Cross-validate all documentation
  - Check DOC.md completeness
  - Validate updated docs accuracy
  - Ensure consistency across files
