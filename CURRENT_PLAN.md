# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: File Indexing & Search System
*The first major "everything app" feature*

## 🎯 Objective

Implement a comprehensive file indexing and search system that scans, catalogs, and enables powerful search across all files on the user's computer. This establishes the foundation for the "everything app" vision.

## 🧠 Strategic Rationale

**Why File Indexing First:**
- **Foundation Feature**: Every "everything app" needs to know what exists on the computer
- **Enables Everything**: Search, AI, automation all depend on file knowledge
- **Architecture Ready**: Database schema designed, IPC patterns established
- **User Value**: Immediate utility - find anything instantly
- **Scalable**: Supports future semantic search, AI analysis, automation

## 📋 Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can scan folders and index all files
- [ ] Fast text-based search across file names, content, metadata
- [ ] Real-time progress tracking for indexing jobs
- [ ] Production-ready performance (handles 100K+ files)
- [ ] Clean UI integration with existing component library
- [ ] Type-safe APIs throughout the stack

## 🔧 EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Database Foundation
*Establish the production database schema*

- [ ] **1.1** - Migrate from test schema to production schema
  - Update `packages/db/src/db/schema.ts` with production tables
  - Generate and run migration from test table to files/metadata tables
  - Validate database operations work with new schema

- [ ] **1.2** - Create database service layer
  - Build `app/main/indexing.ts` with file CRUD operations
  - Implement job tracking (scan progress, status updates)
  - Add efficient search queries with proper indexing

- [ ] **1.3** - Setup IPC handlers for indexing
  - Add indexing IPC methods to `app/main/main.ts`
  - Expose file search, scanning, and job management via preload
  - Validate IPC communication works end-to-end

### Phase 2: File System Scanning
*Core indexing engine that discovers and processes files*

- [ ] **2.1** - Build recursive file scanner
  - Create `app/main/scanner.ts` for efficient file system traversal
  - Handle permissions, symlinks, and large directories gracefully
  - Extract file metadata (size, dates, MIME types)

- [ ] **2.2** - Implement text extraction
  - Add text extraction for common formats (txt, md, pdf, docx)
  - Handle encoding detection and large file chunking
  - Store extracted content in `file_text` table

- [ ] **2.3** - Create job management system
  - Background scanning with progress tracking
  - Pausable/resumable scan operations
  - Error handling and retry logic for failed files

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration
*UI components for indexing control and search*

- [ ] **3.1** - Build indexing interface
  - Create `IndexingView.svelte` for scan management
  - Add folder selection, progress display, job control
  - Integrate with existing settings and navigation

- [ ] **3.2** - Create search interface
  - Build `SearchView.svelte` with advanced search capabilities
  - File type filters, date ranges, size constraints
  - Real-time search results with highlighted matches

- [ ] **3.3** - Add search integration to existing views
  - Global search in Header component
  - File search in FileList/FileGrid components
  - Quick search suggestions and recent searches

### Phase 4: Performance & Polish
*Optimization and production readiness*

- [ ] **4.1** - Optimize database performance
  - Add proper indexes for fast search queries
  - Implement query optimization for large datasets
  - Add database maintenance (cleanup, vacuum)

- [ ] **4.2** - Add search features
  - Fuzzy search for typos and partial matches
  - Search result ranking and relevance scoring
  - Search history and saved searches

- [ ] **4.3** - Performance testing & tuning
  - Test with large file collections (100K+ files)
  - Memory usage optimization
  - Search response time optimization

### Phase 5: User Experience
*Polished features for production use*

- [ ] **5.1** - Add file preview integration
  - Quick preview of search results
  - Thumbnail generation for images
  - Text snippets with search highlights

- [ ] **5.2** - Implement smart features
  - Duplicate file detection
  - File organization suggestions
  - Recent files and frequently accessed

- [ ] **5.3** - Add export/import capabilities
  - Export search results to collections
  - Import existing file indexes
  - Backup and restore index data

## 🏗️ Implementation Architecture

### Database Layer
```
files ← core file metadata
├── file_meta ← extended metadata (EXIF, custom tags)
├── file_text ← extracted text content (chunked)
├── tags ← user and AI-generated tags
└── jobs ← background processing tracking
```

### Main Process APIs
```
window.gc.indexing = {
  scanFolder(path: string): Promise<JobId>
  getJobs(): Promise<Job[]>
  pauseJob(id: JobId): Promise<void>
  
  searchFiles(query: SearchQuery): Promise<SearchResult[]>
  getFileContent(id: number): Promise<FileContent>
  updateFileTags(id: number, tags: string[]): Promise<void>
}
```

### Feature Structure
```
app/renderer/src/ts/features/indexing/
├── types.ts    # SearchQuery, SearchResult, Job interfaces
├── service.ts  # Search operations, job management
└── store.ts    # Search state, job progress, results
```

## 🔄 Execution Protocol

1. **One Task At A Time**: Complete each checkbox before proceeding
2. **Validation**: Run tests and ensure quality after each task
3. **Documentation**: Update component docs as new APIs are added
4. **Integration**: Test with existing components and features
5. **Performance**: Monitor build times and runtime performance

---

## 🚀 Expected Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Database Foundation (1-2 days)
- **Phase 2**: File Scanning Engine (2-3 days)  
- **Phase 3**: Frontend Integration (2-3 days)
- **Phase 4**: Performance & Polish (1-2 days)
