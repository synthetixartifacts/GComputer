# Context

We are on the stabilization and review process of our app.
Your goal here is not to create new code but to analyze specified sections and verify that our logic is flawless, align with our best practices and all.
Do not forget what's on your CLAUDE.md as well as the /docs.

What we want here is to verify and ensure our app is clean and lean and really follow our DRY principle, is component based and follow perfectly our ./docs/coding_standards.md 

Nothing should be hardcoded, always use translation.
No duplicated code or logic.
Code written must be in its proper file and not file should not be too long.
