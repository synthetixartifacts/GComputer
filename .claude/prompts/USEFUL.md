It's a big task and I want you to do it step by step with a clear plan from where we are to where we want to go and what we want to accomplish here.
Really take time to think about the best options available to us to do this, consider our project structure and what's already implemented within codebase and how it's implemented. Make sure to double check things, do not make any assumptions, yes the documentation is good but could be outdated. 

Once you know what you need to know to accomplish your task you will create your plan that will be really linked to our project.
Decide in the best way to do this task for our project, specifications and requirements. 
It's a big project so in everything we do/create/update, the main focus is that we want resusability, DRY and simple clean code.



------


Update documentation.

We did a lot of changes in our last iteration and now it is time to update our documentation.
Our documentation lives in the /docs folder and also in ./DOC.md as well as ./project.md. We also have our CLAUDE.md file that is used to give you context of the project.

You job this time will be to go on and revalidate everything in our app to make sure the documentation corespond and is really up to date.
You have to verify everything under ./app
It's a big task and I want you to do it step by step with a clear plan from where we are to where we want to go and what we want to accomplish here. Make sure to double check things, do not make any assumptions, yes the documentation is good but some section will be outdated and it is your task to enhance and make it up to date.

Make sure to indicate also in CLAUDE.md that this documentation exist and can be used to verify things at any time to help with all coding.
