# New adjustment for the chatbot Ux/ui component 
Theseh adjustment should be on the component level so that everywhere we use a chatbot window we have this.

- On new submit, we scroll down to the printed message
- When an AI answer back we should scroll on streaming except if the user has scroll up during the streaming

We will create a lot of feature like these for our chatbot so verify that everything is dry and if the file created / updated are too long and really segmented per functionallity.

Create a clean structure of file that will be scalable and easily manageable.















## Big Task Alert

It's a big task and I want you to do it step by step with a clear, complete and detailled plan from where we are to where we want to go and what we want to accomplish here.
Your initial planning concept is not directly linked to the execution so the plan need to be as clear as possible. 
Really take time to think about the best options available to us to do this, consider our project structure and what's already implemented within codebase and how it's implemented. Make sure to double check things, do not make any assumptions, yes the documentation is good but could be outdated. Our ./docs/coding_standards.md are always good and you should follow it.

Remember, you can browse the web if you need up to date information, documentation or look for specific libraries at any point.
At anytime if you find something like an error or a new concept that is impacting the plan, make sure to revalidate and assess if the plan is still ok or if it needs adjustments based on the specific situation you are in.

Once you know what you need to know to accomplish your task you will create your plan that will be really linked to our project.
Decide in the best way to do this task for our project, specifications and requirements. 
It's a big project so in everything we do/create/update, the main focus is that we want resusability, DRY and simple clean code.

Do not hesitate in the middle of the execution based on your finding to challenge and revisit the inital plan and redo a planning phase, it is important that your plan go along you coding execution and your discovery.


## New task

I want you to enhance the ux/ui of the input inside the dicusssionn/chatbot page.
I want to enhance its ux and make it available on each agewnt but also based on configuration, like some agent will only be able to drop file, not enter text in input or different combination like this.


































Good, now others things:
- 



Good job. We still have some issue tho
- The sidebar background is not set its like transparent but should be plain like the menu sidebar. Examine and validate and adjut. I think the z-index is not set properly because I see the discussion-sidebar-backdrop like black opacity fade or something like this
- When I click on the refresh button I see "No discussion selected  / Back to List" on screen instead of the empty chat section where I can enter a new message.



What I want is some type of big refactor in our layout.
First in our header.
I want to remove the GComputer app title from the header that is not useful and instead replace it by a container that can easily be manipulated by each view to write the title of the current view.
Make sure to change all current view so that the display title is used and we remove the current h1 from the content because now the title is in the header.
I want to make sure that update page title is a DRY function. We will probably have others utils function for our app like that so validate if there is a good file to place it and if not yet, create a dry utils. 
Validate EACH view and do the changes.

I want to remove our change theme button because I want to be able to place some secondary menu on specific view here so again make this dry for the app to be able to manage this easily on each view.

I want on the discussion section (all pages under /discussion) to add a button up there top right of the header that will open a sidebar right where there will be display the list of agent first and then the top 20 list of discussions with a see all button that redirect to the discussion list page.
Don't forget translation.

Now when in the /discussion/chat page I want to add another button right next to the sidebar on the left of that icon which will be a refresh button which will simply create another discussion with the same agent and reset the view. Simply the same as going to /discussion/chat?agentId=1 for exemple and clean state so that I can easily reset and start over a discussion with the same agent because as we know llm have limited context lenght so everytime we change subjet I will hit that button.

I want to add a right siderbar to our app when I'm on the discussion page.
We already have the sidebar component in the app\renderer\src\components\sidebar\Sidebar.svelte so lets reuse this to keep things dry.




What I want is some type of big refactor in our layout.
First in our header.
I want to remove our change theme button. I also want to remove the GComputer app from the header that is not useful and instead place on both a container that can easily be manipulated by each view to write the title of the current view.










Right now we are feed ou db seed with the keys from openAi and anthorpic from the .env_secret but doing so this means that it is still visible in the packages\db\data\gcomputer.db
I want to change the way we manage this.

We should not place it in seed, instead we should in the load of the provider when we call the this.provider.secretKey, if empty, we will look at our .env_secret to get the key if it exist.

Look at how we manage secret config because we have a manager for that. We will have to remove code for seeding first too.
Make sure its clean and safe here.

I think the right place to do this is app\renderer\src\ts\features\ai-communication\adapters\base.ts because we will only have to place this at this file. Verify and identify the best place for this process to happen so that its dry.










Lets focus on on vibe and style now.

Here is some issue I have withing the discussion / chatbot / ux-ui of the chatbot secton used in /discussion/ route and /development/ai/communication route too.
First things first is to verify that we are using configurable resusable component and that only the view/ux-ui differ.
But the deep logic remain.
Especially for the disucssion pannel.
We need to have ai message and user message be by default 90% of the space. 
global style are need for this. No specific at this point.





We are working on our discussion logic and here are the issue I see right now 
- this key styleguide.chatbot.messages.Copy instead of the translation and the copied too. All other text are tranlated
- I want to remove for now the "U" "A" bubble in css and remove this
- I want the input / textarea section for the user input to be always be sticky bottom 0 exept when to bottom is coming then it takes it place naturally







# Situation / current situation

Still the two time printed ai message like this

<div class="w-full flex justify-start"><div class="flex items-end gap-2 flex-row" aria-label="Assistant"><div class="w-8 h-8 rounded-full shrink-0 flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-300 text-xs text-gray-700 dark:bg-gray-600 dark:text-gray-100" aria-hidden="true">A<!----></div><!----> <div class="max-w-[75%] md:max-w-[66%] lg:max-w-[60%]"><div class="px-3 py-2 bg-gray-200 text-gray-900 dark:bg-gray-700 dark:text-gray-100 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-bl-2xl rounded-tr-2xl rounded-br-2xl"><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap leading-relaxed">I'm Claude!

and


<div class="w-full flex justify-start"><div class="flex items-end gap-2 flex-row" aria-label="Assistant"><!----> <div class="max-w-[75%] md:max-w-[66%] lg:max-w-[60%]"><div class="px-3 py-2 bg-gray-200 text-gray-900 dark:bg-gray-700 dark:text-gray-100 rounded-tl-md rounded-bl-2xl rounded-tr-2xl rounded-br-2xl"><p class="whitespace-pre-wrap leading-relaxed">I'm Claude!

Also -

We need to enable the scroll logic on message / response as well as the copy logic in our discussion. We talk about at some point that discussion compoenent / chatbot ux/ui will evolve and its one of this time.

I want to implement in our context, so adapt things for our style/structrue the feature scroll and copy message concept per bubble from 
- .ahhub\assets\js\ai\chatbot\scrollButtons.js scroll to message on answer and button 
- .ahhub\assets\js\ai\chatbot\chatZone.js copy button per bubble

Implement these in our project inside our component chatbox discussion. Revisit our current logic if needed to be able to scale with more and more feature like this.

Keep it clean and component focused.



















Ok now the call are perfect but when I click submit we have multiple issue:
- My own message is not printed
- I see "AI is thinking" 
- I dont get the message stream back by the chat view

Its is working perfectly in /development/ai/communication so use this logic for the chatbot view and also make sure to reuse available componants or update the existing one while making them more dry and parameters based. Both section should be doing the same and using the same logic pretty much but the ux/ui is different

When I talk to the ai in the development section its working and the call is this

{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant. Be concise and accurate."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "hello"
        }
    ],
    "stream": true,
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "max_tokens": 4096
}


But when we talk to ai in the discussion setup it is not working.
It should be the same logic but with memory, right now the call input is

{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant. Be concise and accurate."
        },
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant. Be concise and accurate."
        },
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "<conversation_history>\n## User\nhello there\n</conversation_history>"
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "hello there"
        }
    ],
    "stream": true,
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "max_tokens": 4096
}

Which is not ok, like system is there 3 times and the conversation history should, first not be there if its the first message and if its not the same message it should all be in the user type message like this

------
<conversation_history>
## User message
Hello there

## AI Agent / YOU
Hi, how are you doing?
</conversation_history>

# New User message to answer to
I'm good, I would like to know about the sky, why is it blue?
-----

All of this in the same user message.










In our provider entity we have a Secret Key field.
I dont want to place it in my seed, as these are private information and dont want it in git for security reason.
To be able to have a fallback on local we will use the .env file and look for secretKey concat to "_key" ex: openai_key

We already have a logic to look at value from .env for the mode. Have a look at what we did and if it is not already a componant make it one, create a config manager / function component where we will group all of system config get/set from .env but also other possible files. 

I think we should also probably do another file where we should place ourkey. I have create .env_secret for that.

# NEW FEATURE/COMPONENT

## Way to plan and execute
This job is a really really heavy one so your plan must be in consequence. 
We need a complete, big and multi step / sub step plan that we can track and follow and be confident that we then at the end have something like an MVP.

We need to have a lot of new component and code develop but remind yourself that we want thing to be componant driven and DRY at all time. No scss in files, no overlap of logic in component, each part of our logic will either reuse an existing component or create new independant ones.

We already have a lot of existing component so make sure to list them before you start coding so that you are not recreating something that exist. 

Don't forget about translations.

When you're confident that what you did is at a production ready state, you will verify the key point through unit testing. Once you are at this steps you will need to rething about everything you did and create a new clear and detailed plan just for that. Make it clear in your initial plan that you will have to rethink and replan at this steps because a lot of things will probably differ from your initial plan as you go on and discover things.

We have a lot of up to date documentation you can check at any time to verify things. 
If you need specific libraries or third-party libraries or you are hitting a wall, do not forget that you can browse and search the web for up to date answer.
Always ground yourself in the current project and do not overreach.


## New task goal/context


What I want is to create to now focus on the concept of discussion that the user will have with agents/ai.
Discussion will be saved and acessible at all time by the user to view and continue the thread.
A discussion will be a new entity that needs to be save in our dbs.
A disucssion will have
- id
- title (Default = "New Discussion")
- isFavorite
- agent (a discussion is linked to an agent with whom the user started the discussion with)
- messages (one to many message relation - maybe not needed in this table)
- created_at
- updated_at

A discussion will be composed of messages, we need to create this entity too.
A message will have
- id
- who ("user" or "agent" to be able to know who said this message)
- content (content of the message, can be really big obviously)
- discussion_id (many to one)
- create_at

So we need to create the table but also the entity manage/service/whatever is needed to manage and access these at any point, anywhere we want.

Once we have these created we these entity we need a way for the user to go on a have discussions with different agent.
We will create multiple new view/menu

We will add a new menu item which will be :
- Discussions
  - Create New
  - See All 

### Create new - Page
In this page we will first see all our available agent. The user decide which agent he want to talk to and this open the chat bot to which he can talk and iterate.

### See All
In this page we see a listing / table of all our discussion we had. We see the favorite icon/toggle, title, the agent name, the updated_at date.
If the user click on it we then go on to the chat page.

So we need to have three main pages which is "List of discussion", "Agent Selection", "Chat" page where the user can chat with the agent.
Create and coming back to a new discussion should be the same page for dry reason and better management.

### Favorite
We will then manage the feature of being able to favorite a discussion. We can only favorite a discussion with at leat one message.

### Note
- We save a message once it's DONE. For the user is on submit, but for the agent we need to wait for the stream (if stream) to finish completly.
- If the configuration of the agent (a json you can look at app\main\db\seeding.ts) contains the value useMemory = true, we are sending back all the messages in order from the user and the agent itself back and then the new user message so that the llm can have a memory of the conversation
Like:

<conversation_history>
## User message
Hello there

## AI Agent / YOU
Hi, how are you doing?
</conversation_history>

<new_user_message>
I'm good, I would like to know about the sky, why is it blue?
</new_user_message>

As our capture feature is its own component you will do the testing yourself be calling it through its own testing api service. And debug until you are confident there is no error anymore and the file is properly capture and saved. I am not sure but at some point we use a local file like the folder screenshots to save our printscreen and being able to view it within our local wsl app and not appdata which is outside of our folder its in the windows env not our linux. 
So we could maybe test/have a rule that when our .env is in mode=dev we do this the same as for the menu. I'm really not sure about this but it could do the trick. 
We generated a lot of code for like the linux wsl env and if we go that route I dont think we will need it anymore. we should really try to keep our code clean and lean.

Think about this and create your proper plan with testing an iteration until it works.

--------------------

But GOOD NEWS HERE:

In my compiled version I indeed see my preview, good job. We have issue tho, first I don't want to confirm with start preview, it should go on always directly. Then If I have multiple screen every options shows the preview of my main primary screen. The capture tho is working perfectly for each selected screen except the ALL Display, but for now let just hide this options in css.


In my local we also have good news, its that I see now my mouse moving when I open the preview modal. I guess its a limitation of wsl2 or something like this that the preview is black, if it can be fixed go for it, if not leave it like this.

As its working in compiled only make the changes to fix the capture for local env. But still fix the preview for my actual selected screen

--------------------





Here is the latest documentation if it helps

------------

desktopCapturer
Access information about media sources that can be used to capture audio and video from the desktop using the navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia API.

Process: Main

The following example shows how to capture video from a desktop window whose title is Electron:

// main.js
const { app, BrowserWindow, desktopCapturer, session } = require('electron')

app.whenReady().then(() => {
  const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow()

  session.defaultSession.setDisplayMediaRequestHandler((request, callback) => {
    desktopCapturer.getSources({ types: ['screen'] }).then((sources) => {
      // Grant access to the first screen found.
      callback({ video: sources[0], audio: 'loopback' })
    })
    // If true, use the system picker if available.
    // Note: this is currently experimental. If the system picker
    // is available, it will be used and the media request handler
    // will not be invoked.
  }, { useSystemPicker: true })

  mainWindow.loadFile('index.html')
})

// renderer.js
const startButton = document.getElementById('startButton')
const stopButton = document.getElementById('stopButton')
const video = document.querySelector('video')

startButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia({
    audio: true,
    video: {
      width: 320,
      height: 240,
      frameRate: 30
    }
  }).then(stream => {
    video.srcObject = stream
    video.onloadedmetadata = (e) => video.play()
  }).catch(e => console.log(e))
})

stopButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  video.pause()
})

<!-- index.html -->
<html>
<meta http-equiv="content-security-policy" content="script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'" />
  <body>
    <button id="startButton" class="button">Start</button>
    <button id="stopButton" class="button">Stop</button>
    <video width="320" height="240" autoplay></video>
    <script src="renderer.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

See navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia for more information.

note
navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia does not permit the use of deviceId for selection of a source - see specification.

Methods
The desktopCapturer module has the following methods:

desktopCapturer.getSources(options)
options Object
types string[] - An array of strings that lists the types of desktop sources to be captured, available types can be screen and window.
thumbnailSize Size (optional) - The size that the media source thumbnail should be scaled to. Default is 150 x 150. Set width or height to 0 when you do not need the thumbnails. This will save the processing time required for capturing the content of each window and screen.
fetchWindowIcons boolean (optional) - Set to true to enable fetching window icons. The default value is false. When false the appIcon property of the sources return null. Same if a source has the type screen.
Returns Promise<DesktopCapturerSource[]> - Resolves with an array of DesktopCapturerSource objects, each DesktopCapturerSource represents a screen or an individual window that can be captured.

note
Capturing the screen contents requires user consent on macOS 10.15 Catalina or higher, which can detected by systemPreferences.getMediaAccessStatus.

Caveats
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia does not work on macOS for audio capture due to a fundamental limitation whereby apps that want to access the system's audio require a signed kernel extension. Chromium, and by extension Electron, does not provide this.

It is possible to circumvent this limitation by capturing system audio with another macOS app like Soundflower and passing it through a virtual audio input device. This virtual device can then be queried with navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia.

-----------------













I see multiple issue now.
When we click the capute button in the modal, the modal claose and the button are not reseting which mean I cannot do multiple capture I need to reload the window which is not ok.
In my live preview feed, I still only see a black screen. In my compiled app the capture image is ok so for now lets really focus on fixing the live screen preview feature/componant. Really look in depth the web to find based on our setup what is happening.
Its the same wheter we are in our dev env in "npm run dev" in a wsl or in our .exe compiled app. Black screen. 
We really need to have the preview mode properly correct, look at documentation, compare with our code, adjust and FIX IT.




ok, we did make some change for the component to be better designed, do we still need all the current file we have like    
app\renderer\src\views\development\features\FeatureProgrammaticCaptureView.svelte
app\renderer\src\views\development\features\FeatureCaptureScreenView.svelte

all file under app\renderer\src\components\computer

I dont think we need all of them.
Our goal is to have simple reusable DRY component.
To have a view in renderer accessible from our menu item Development > Feature > Capture Screen where we see a listing and a record button.

Our componant should be segmented in two 
- Live screen preview where we see the current selected display and in it we also have the display selection. This is "just" the ui/ux to be able to select and configure params that will be pass to CaptureScreen with the live preview
- CaptureScreen componant that handles the real capture of the screen in its own component and can be trigger wherever, whenever with params so that it can yes be trigger by the user in frontend but also by some screen at some point.

We should have only one view for now in developement.
I really want simple componant.




So, in the compile app, when I launched the .exe the modal is still scrollable left right for the capture screen modal


We just did a lot of changes for our capture screen process.
I want to review all the changes and also make the code more component focus.
The screen recording and capture component should not be linked to the modal. It needs to happen in a modal in the renderer view but the componants itself should all not be attached to modal at all... We need to review that.
So we will have these componants:
- Live screen preview where we see the current selected display and in it we also have the display selection. This is "just" the ui/ux to be able to select and configure params that will be pass to CaptureScreen with the live preview
- CaptureScreen componant that handles the real capture of the screen in its own component and can be trigger wherever, whenever with params so that it can yes be trigger by the user in frontend but also by some screen at some point.

There is a lot of code that was created for this feature 


We are well underway in the setup ou our new component / feature which let the app cature the current display/screen of the user.
We have some on-going issue I want to fix.
First is that on the modal where we record the screen there is a live visual feed thats supposed to be printed, right now it is not working, it shows a black screen and not the user computer screen. It could be an issue with our dev environment but when I compile the app and test it, it does the same issue, black screen. For your information if I capture a screenshot, in the compile mode I indeed see the screen capture in the image, its the whole screen as its suppose to be, but in a dev mode, in the electron app the image capture is black.
Also if I try in my browser the feature is completly disable (which is ok right now). 
Validate the current code, the current used librarie, the current way we save our image, the current way we display the "live feed of the screen". Think about our needed adjustment to make this works properly, validate with a browsing action to make sure we are using latest available libraries and all for our context. Make a search. Once you have everything, re-adjust your plan and then fix it live display, fix the capture image all black on npm run dev.

Take time to analyse the current cobase, do not make assumption, really dig deep

It's a big task and I want you to do it step by step with a clear, complete and detailled plan from where we are to where we want to go and what we want to accomplish here.
Your initial planning concept is not directly linked to the execution so the plan need to be as clear as possible. 
Really take time to think about the best options available to us to do this, consider our project structure and what's already implemented within codebase and how it's implemented. Make sure to double check things, do not make any assumptions, yes the documentation is good but could be outdated. 

Remember, you can browse the web if you need up to date information, documentation or look for specific libraries at any point.
At anytime if you find something like an error or a new concept that is impacting the plan, make sure to revalidate and asses if the plan is still ok or if it needs adjustments based on the specific situation you are in.

Once you know what you need to know to accomplish your task you will create your plan that will be really linked to our project.
Decide in the best way to do this task for our project, specifications and requirements. 
It's a big project so in everything we do/create/update, the main focus is that we want resusability, DRY and simple clean code.








So I just compiled my app using  npm run package:win and I still dont see the Development menu and admin menu even tho my .env mode is set to dev.

Right now we have a menu and a routing.
In each we manage the availability of pages based on "npm" mode from like run dev vs npm run package:win for exemple.
In the release/packaged version right now I dont see no menu item others than Home / Settings.
Its was ok before but I want to change how this is manage, how now want it based on a configuration file we have locally so that even in a packages I can test some beta feature when the app is "compiled"
I had in mind to use the file ./.env and the value in it mode. When mode=dev we display the menu items and give route available
Do the update and make sure to validate this concept in the app overall everywhere.

While at it, make sure to verify that our code is optimal, properly setup and all to be able to scale and add more complex logic in our routing.

In the modal where we select the display to capture I want a full width live visual representation of my selection. Then underneath we will have the options in one line.




We are working on the concept of the app being able to "see the screen".
It is located right now under the page dev>feature>"
For sure examine yourself the current real code situation but here is what is happening right now in the frontend:
- I don't see the images in the listing. I see either empty image in the electron app like I see the images section the name, I can click on it but I don't see the image itself its like not found. If I click on the image tho I can see my images so the image itself is om its on the listing itself that its not displayed properly it can be we that do not manage it properly but it can also be the component itself, double check this.
- The saving of the printscreen is not working anymore

NEW FEATURE/COMPONENT


I want to create a new section inder development>features that will be capture screen.

On this new page we will develop and test the concept of the app being able to "see the screen"
The first concept of this complete feature I want to test is the capture of the screen.
What I want is to for the page to have a button "View Screen" which will for now:
- Trigger a printscreen of the computer screen
- Save the file in our app. We need a new folder for computer assets we will generate/use in our app. Lets go for the new folder ./assets/printscreen. We will name the file ps_datetime.jpg or png depending on the library best practice you will choose to do that.
- We will have a gallery of our already create printscreen using GalleryGrid component we have. 

The capture of the screen needs to be managed as a component that we will place in component/computer/capture

# Note of the current situation:
We already started this steps but it is not fully working.
- First we see translation keys instead of values, so verify this, remeber that everywhere else it is working so you can always double check if needed.
- Second, the capture flow is working as it saves a file but the file right now is simply all black instead of the computer current screen.
- Third, when we capture a new files the listing of image is misbehaving as we don't see the images we see like missing file icon but if I refresh my app I see proper images
- Where are my files in my app folder? I can't find the ./assets/computer folder right now

---------------------

















So we are advancing.
The modal is ok but right now the content goes over I think we should add box-sizing: content-box; to .gc-modal__dialog
Next, I can tell you that the number of screen is ok and if I go to the right screen I can see my mouse but there is multiple issue.
even if I see my mouse 
I want to test this in a compile way so for now we will do this, I've create a file ./.env which contain this right now
"
mode=dev
"

Not sure if this is the classic way of doing this, in symfony it is, if needed adapt for our project context. 
When the mode on my .env config file is dev we are showing the dev menu item else we do not.





I still see empty image in my listing.
Lets do this now:
- Replace "View Screen" label by "Record Screen"
- When we click the "Record Screen" button a modal opens and in that modal we see
  - The current live view of the screen
  - If we record that we have multiple screen we offers like a way of selecting which screen to capture/view.
  - A Capture button that will take the screenshot
- Right now in this section / page as it is under development menu item we will save the image in the app folder itself for this page but in the component of prinscreening it, really the component that management this process only and not the page the path is configurable.

Revalidate every file right now to make sure you are up to date, do not make any assumptions.

TODO




The app is evolving fast and we want to make things clean and properly structure.
We are starting to have a lot of view under app\renderer\src\views. I want you to restructure this so that views are segmented per section.
You will follow the architecture of our menu. Make sure to think about what the implcation of moving a view means and how it affect our app so you can then make sure we update our codebase all the affected files.

We right now have our url for the developement under /test (ex: test/styleguide/base) which is not representing of our realt menu and code structure. We also have the admin section under /test like /test/admin/entity/provider

I want to change this so that the Development section fall under the /development and admin under /admin.
I want you to make the changes, and validate the route and everything this change can impact so there is no regression issue.











Issue I want to be fixed:

The new menu item as been added under Admin section instead of Development/AI.
Also the the page does not seems to use the chatbot ux/ui component we have and use in the test/styleguide/chatbot page.

Create a complete comprehensive plan to review and fix this.









--------------


We are right now at an important step of our project.
We want make the communication layer to AI providers.

The best solution I have in mind for now is a centralized manager and provider-specific adapters.

We have multiple options:
* Create our own api rest api manager to hit the openAI, anthropic and every other provider we will have.
* Use js / ts librarie that provider existe to call it.
* In between where we have our own centralized manager and an abstract layer underneath which depending on the provider call we redirect to the external functions.

I think that for easiness as well as maintenability and scalability we should go with number 3.

I want for this turn to create our base concept for the centralized with the library/sdk of openAI and anthropic.
So we will create the logic for AI communication. 

We need to have a new concept in our app that will be there to manage the communication with ai provider.
Later on this section will be grown to host everything related to interacting with ai like discussion, message, memory etc so structure it so it can grow but for now only focus on creating the part where we communicate with provider.

We will have our centralized file with which the app will interact and then this file will have like its own router function to distribute the call to proper sdk.
For now we will create the function to call an llm, to stream with an llm. We will later add the tts, stt, vision, etc... but for now lets only focus on simple message communication in both call and stream.

Verify the current sdk there is for both with browser search to be sure.

The centralized file will also manage the fact that in our app we interact with agent and not direct model or provider. Make sure to check our code base to understand and verify what I mean. 
So the centralized file will have to have function where talk, steam are with an agent as argument along a message and from the agent extract the model and from the model extract the provider and the route and then extract proper messages to return based on either library/sdk and/or the configuration we right now have in the providers/models. Verify our code but also the seeds file so you know what an exemple of each entity look like.

Once we have our new structure we need a way to verify that its working.
To do so we will create a new page under Development menu item which will be AI and a sub page which is Communication Test.
In this page we will an interface with :
- List of agent dropdown select 
- Communication style - Select with for now Message / Stream options
- Our Chatbot component where we can enter a message and that message will then be sent to our agent with the communication style.

We will then be able to test the communication process in all different option from this page.

It is possible that the Chatbot component is not yet fully compatible for our use case like stream and such so we will have to update it while making sure everything we do goes into the same component reusable concept we have all over our app.


What I want from you right now is not starting coding, it's not giving me back the files to create specifically or the codeline. 
You are the planner. Your main goal for this turn is to elaborate a really really detailled plan for this steps.

This plan will be sent to claude code to be executed and it needs to be clear in term of objective, step by step, current situation, goal of this big step, end result expected etc... Everything that is needed for Claude code to execute this task as flowesly as possible.
Ground your thinking from the current code we have. Ground this plan from the goal our our app and what we want to do with it and how we do things in our codebase.

It will be a big task and we want to really go deep dive into thinking right now so that the plan is clear and adapted and validated.
Really take time to think about the best options available to us to do this, consider our project structure and what's already implemented within codebase and how it's implemented. Make sure to double check things, do not make any assumptions, yes the documentation is good but could be outdated. 
Once you know what you need to know to accomplish your task you will create your plan that will be really linked to our project.
Decide in the best way to do this task for our project, specifications and requirements. 
It's a big project so in everything we do/create/update, the main focus is that we want resusability, DRY and simple clean code.

Now its time for you to go on, and execute YOUR goal for this turn.


So your task for this turn is to have a look at our current codebase to understand how we currently manage our entity and fields

We now are updating our entities.
I want new fields.

For the AI Providers I want
- Secret key (that will contains our key to hit theses APIs). Save plain as is for now, we will think later on on a best way to save this in our app but more secure.

For the AI Models I want:
- messageLocation (where the real answer is on the model response. ex: choices[0].message.content)
- messageStreamLocation (where the real streamed answer is on the model response. ex: choices[0].delta.content)

I want you to do it step by step with a clear plan from where we are to where we want to go and what we want to accomplish here.

Still not working.
We we open the modal for provider, the dropdown for "Authentication" is working.
But the dropdown in the model modal that is supposed to show which provider is linked to the model is not working. I see the available providers but it does not select the one already linked to my model when we open the modal.
It is not working on save the listing is adjusting properly tho.








I have a multiple plan for you to execute.

We just added some logic to manage our entities that we have in db right now from the frontend.
We are managing providers, models and agents.

Models are linked to providers in a one to many relationship.
Agent are linked to models in a one to many relationship.

The issue for all relationship linked is this, let me explain with the models but its the same for all relationship linked.
When we go to edit the models, in the modal, we see the provider field is not set. 
And when we save the model with a provider selected, then in the listing we see written "Unknown"

I want you to also validate this concept in all our entities, and make sure that we have a good way to manage this using our usual DRY concept and components.
We want to be able to edit the relationship linked in the modal and save it.




Again what you did is not working, you should focus on make the interface works, not the backend logic. Its a view problem where we dont see the representation of the relationship in the modal.
The value is there, we just need to display it.

In app\renderer\src\components\admin\AdminEntityManager.svelte and app\renderer\src\components\admin\AdminFormModal.svelte there should not be any harcoded logic specific to models/providers/agents or any other entity, it should be generic, and the field type should be a relationship field and we send the id and the label.
We should have have (fieldId.endsWith('Id') || fieldId === 'providerId' || fieldId === 'modelId'); or such.
We need to think of a better way to manage relationship overall because we will have a lot more entities and relationships in the future. We really want to avoid hardcoded logic and have a generic way to manage this.
Think about this, make your master plan clearly setup and then go on and execute while always making sure what you do is clean and lean.
It's a big and important task for the future of the project and I want to do it step by step. Really take time to think about the best options available to us to do this, consider our project structure and overall already implemented codebase. Then decide in the best one adapted to our project, specifications and requirements. We want resusability, DRY and simple clean code.

We are managing a db with multiple tables right now in our app, to prevent the db.ts file to become too big I want to segment the file into multiple files if possible.
Look at all related file for our db / table management and make sure that we are following best practices in term of coding and architecture so that our app will be easy to maintain and extend.
