Right now we have a menu and a routing.
In each we manage the availability of pages based on "npm" mode from like run dev vs npm run package:win for exemple.
In the release/packaged version right now I dont see no menu item others than Home / Settings.
Its was ok before but I want to change how this is manage, how now want it based on a configuration file we have locally so that even in a packages I can test some beta feature when the app is "compiled"
I had in mind to use the file ./.env and the value in it mode. When mode=dev we display the menu items and give route available
Do the update and make sure to validate this concept in the app overall everywhere.

While at it, make sure to verify that our code is optimal, properly setup and all to be able to scale and add more complex logic in our routing.

It's a big task and I want you to do it step by step with a clear, complete and detailled plan from where we are to where we want to go and what we want to accomplish here.
Your initial planning concept is not directly linked to the execution so the plan need to be as clear as possible. 
Really take time to think about the best options available to us to do this, consider our project structure and what's already implemented within codebase and how it's implemented. Make sure to double check things, do not make any assumptions, yes the documentation is good but could be outdated. 

Remember, you can browse the web if you need up to date information, documentation or look for specific libraries at any point.
At anytime if you find something like an error or a new concept that is impacting the plan, make sure to revalidate and asses if the plan is still ok or if it needs adjustments based on the specific situation you are in.

Once you know what you need to know to accomplish your task you will create your plan that will be really linked to our project.
Decide in the best way to do this task for our project, specifications and requirements. 
It's a big project so in everything we do/create/update, the main focus is that we want resusability, DRY and simple clean code.







In the modal where we select the display to capture I want a full width live visual representation of my selection. Then underneath we will have the options in one line.




We are working on the concept of the app being able to "see the screen".
It is located right now under the page dev>feature>"
For sure examine yourself the current real code situation but here is what is happening right now in the frontend:
- I don't see the images in the listing. I see either empty image in the electron app like I see the images section the name, I can click on it but I don't see the image itself its like not found. If I click on the image tho I can see my images so the image itself is om its on the listing itself that its not displayed properly it can be we that do not manage it properly but it can also be the component itself, double check this.
- The saving of the printscreen is not working anymore

NEW FEATURE/COMPONENT


I want to create a new section inder development>features that will be capture screen.

On this new page we will develop and test the concept of the app being able to "see the screen"
The first concept of this complete feature I want to test is the capture of the screen.
What I want is to for the page to have a button "View Screen" which will for now:
- Trigger a printscreen of the computer screen
- Save the file in our app. We need a new folder for computer assets we will generate/use in our app. Lets go for the new folder ./assets/printscreen. We will name the file ps_datetime.jpg or png depending on the library best practice you will choose to do that.
- We will have a gallery of our already create printscreen using GalleryGrid component we have. 

The capture of the screen needs to be managed as a component that we will place in component/computer/capture

# Note of the current situation:
We already started this steps but it is not fully working.
- First we see translation keys instead of values, so verify this, remeber that everywhere else it is working so you can always double check if needed.
- Second, the capture flow is working as it saves a file but the file right now is simply all black instead of the computer current screen.
- Third, when we capture a new files the listing of image is misbehaving as we don't see the images we see like missing file icon but if I refresh my app I see proper images
- Where are my files in my app folder? I can't find the ./assets/computer folder right now

---------------------

















So we are advancing.
The modal is ok but right now the content goes over I think we should add box-sizing: content-box; to .gc-modal__dialog
Next, I can tell you that the number of screen is ok and if I go to the right screen I can see my mouse but there is multiple issue.
even if I see my mouse 
I want to test this in a compile way so for now we will do this, I've create a file ./.env which contain this right now
"
mode=dev
"

Not sure if this is the classic way of doing this, in symfony it is, if needed adapt for our project context. 
When the mode on my .env config file is dev we are showing the dev menu item else we do not.





I still see empty image in my listing.
Lets do this now:
- Replace "View Screen" label by "Record Screen"
- When we click the "Record Screen" button a modal opens and in that modal we see
  - The current live view of the screen
  - If we record that we have multiple screen we offers like a way of selecting which screen to capture/view.
  - A Capture button that will take the screenshot
- Right now in this section / page as it is under development menu item we will save the image in the app folder itself for this page but in the component of prinscreening it, really the component that management this process only and not the page the path is configurable.

Revalidate every file right now to make sure you are up to date, do not make any assumptions.

TODO




The app is evolving fast and we want to make things clean and properly structure.
We are starting to have a lot of view under app\renderer\src\views. I want you to restructure this so that views are segmented per section.
You will follow the architecture of our menu. Make sure to think about what the implcation of moving a view means and how it affect our app so you can then make sure we update our codebase all the affected files.

We right now have our url for the developement under /test (ex: test/styleguide/base) which is not representing of our realt menu and code structure. We also have the admin section under /test like /test/admin/entity/provider

I want to change this so that the Development section fall under the /development and admin under /admin.
I want you to make the changes, and validate the route and everything this change can impact so there is no regression issue.











Issue I want to be fixed:

The new menu item as been added under Admin section instead of Development/AI.
Also the the page does not seems to use the chatbot ux/ui component we have and use in the test/styleguide/chatbot page.

Create a complete comprehensive plan to review and fix this.









--------------


We are right now at an important step of our project.
We want make the communication layer to AI providers.

The best solution I have in mind for now is a centralized manager and provider-specific adapters.

We have multiple options:
* Create our own api rest api manager to hit the openAI, anthropic and every other provider we will have.
* Use js / ts librarie that provider existe to call it.
* In between where we have our own centralized manager and an abstract layer underneath which depending on the provider call we redirect to the external functions.

I think that for easiness as well as maintenability and scalability we should go with number 3.

I want for this turn to create our base concept for the centralized with the library/sdk of openAI and anthropic.
So we will create the logic for AI communication. 

We need to have a new concept in our app that will be there to manage the communication with ai provider.
Later on this section will be grown to host everything related to interacting with ai like discussion, message, memory etc so structure it so it can grow but for now only focus on creating the part where we communicate with provider.

We will have our centralized file with which the app will interact and then this file will have like its own router function to distribute the call to proper sdk.
For now we will create the function to call an llm, to stream with an llm. We will later add the tts, stt, vision, etc... but for now lets only focus on simple message communication in both call and stream.

Verify the current sdk there is for both with browser search to be sure.

The centralized file will also manage the fact that in our app we interact with agent and not direct model or provider. Make sure to check our code base to understand and verify what I mean. 
So the centralized file will have to have function where talk, steam are with an agent as argument along a message and from the agent extract the model and from the model extract the provider and the route and then extract proper messages to return based on either library/sdk and/or the configuration we right now have in the providers/models. Verify our code but also the seeds file so you know what an exemple of each entity look like.

Once we have our new structure we need a way to verify that its working.
To do so we will create a new page under Development menu item which will be AI and a sub page which is Communication Test.
In this page we will an interface with :
- List of agent dropdown select 
- Communication style - Select with for now Message / Stream options
- Our Chatbot component where we can enter a message and that message will then be sent to our agent with the communication style.

We will then be able to test the communication process in all different option from this page.

It is possible that the Chatbot component is not yet fully compatible for our use case like stream and such so we will have to update it while making sure everything we do goes into the same component reusable concept we have all over our app.


What I want from you right now is not starting coding, it's not giving me back the files to create specifically or the codeline. 
You are the planner. Your main goal for this turn is to elaborate a really really detailled plan for this steps.

This plan will be sent to claude code to be executed and it needs to be clear in term of objective, step by step, current situation, goal of this big step, end result expected etc... Everything that is needed for Claude code to execute this task as flowesly as possible.
Ground your thinking from the current code we have. Ground this plan from the goal our our app and what we want to do with it and how we do things in our codebase.

It will be a big task and we want to really go deep dive into thinking right now so that the plan is clear and adapted and validated.
Really take time to think about the best options available to us to do this, consider our project structure and what's already implemented within codebase and how it's implemented. Make sure to double check things, do not make any assumptions, yes the documentation is good but could be outdated. 
Once you know what you need to know to accomplish your task you will create your plan that will be really linked to our project.
Decide in the best way to do this task for our project, specifications and requirements. 
It's a big project so in everything we do/create/update, the main focus is that we want resusability, DRY and simple clean code.

Now its time for you to go on, and execute YOUR goal for this turn.


So your task for this turn is to have a look at our current codebase to understand how we currently manage our entity and fields

We now are updating our entities.
I want new fields.

For the AI Providers I want
- Secret key (that will contains our key to hit theses APIs). Save plain as is for now, we will think later on on a best way to save this in our app but more secure.

For the AI Models I want:
- messageLocation (where the real answer is on the model response. ex: choices[0].message.content)
- messageStreamLocation (where the real streamed answer is on the model response. ex: choices[0].delta.content)

I want you to do it step by step with a clear plan from where we are to where we want to go and what we want to accomplish here.

Still not working.
We we open the modal for provider, the dropdown for "Authentication" is working.
But the dropdown in the model modal that is supposed to show which provider is linked to the model is not working. I see the available providers but it does not select the one already linked to my model when we open the modal.
It is not working on save the listing is adjusting properly tho.








I have a multiple plan for you to execute.

We just added some logic to manage our entities that we have in db right now from the frontend.
We are managing providers, models and agents.

Models are linked to providers in a one to many relationship.
Agent are linked to models in a one to many relationship.

The issue for all relationship linked is this, let me explain with the models but its the same for all relationship linked.
When we go to edit the models, in the modal, we see the provider field is not set. 
And when we save the model with a provider selected, then in the listing we see written "Unknown"

I want you to also validate this concept in all our entities, and make sure that we have a good way to manage this using our usual DRY concept and components.
We want to be able to edit the relationship linked in the modal and save it.




Again what you did is not working, you should focus on make the interface works, not the backend logic. Its a view problem where we dont see the representation of the relationship in the modal.
The value is there, we just need to display it.

In app\renderer\src\components\admin\AdminEntityManager.svelte and app\renderer\src\components\admin\AdminFormModal.svelte there should not be any harcoded logic specific to models/providers/agents or any other entity, it should be generic, and the field type should be a relationship field and we send the id and the label.
We should have have (fieldId.endsWith('Id') || fieldId === 'providerId' || fieldId === 'modelId'); or such.
We need to think of a better way to manage relationship overall because we will have a lot more entities and relationships in the future. We really want to avoid hardcoded logic and have a generic way to manage this.
Think about this, make your master plan clearly setup and then go on and execute while always making sure what you do is clean and lean.
It's a big and important task for the future of the project and I want to do it step by step. Really take time to think about the best options available to us to do this, consider our project structure and overall already implemented codebase. Then decide in the best one adapted to our project, specifications and requirements. We want resusability, DRY and simple clean code.

We are managing a db with multiple tables right now in our app, to prevent the db.ts file to become too big I want to segment the file into multiple files if possible.
Look at all related file for our db / table management and make sure that we are following best practices in term of coding and architecture so that our app will be easy to maintain and extend.
