Still not working.
We we open the modal for provider, the dropdown for "Authentication" is working.
But the dropdown in the model modal that is supposed to show which provider is linked to the model is not working. I see the available providers but it does not select the one already linked to my model when we open the modal.
It is not working on save the listing is adjusting properly tho.








I have a multiple plan for you to execute.

We just added some logic to manage our entities that we have in db right now from the frontend.
We are managing providers, models and agents.

Models are linked to providers in a one to many relationship.
Agent are linked to models in a one to many relationship.

The issue for all relationship linked is this, let me explain with the models but its the same for all relationship linked.
When we go to edit the models, in the modal, we see the provider field is not set. 
And when we save the model with a provider selected, then in the listing we see written "Unknown"

I want you to also validate this concept in all our entities, and make sure that we have a good way to manage this using our usual DRY concept and components.
We want to be able to edit the relationship linked in the modal and save it.




Again what you did is not working, you should focus on make the interface works, not the backend logic. Its a view problem where we dont see the representation of the relationship in the modal.
The value is there, we just need to display it.

In app\renderer\src\components\admin\AdminEntityManager.svelte and app\renderer\src\components\admin\AdminFormModal.svelte there should not be any harcoded logic specific to models/providers/agents or any other entity, it should be generic, and the field type should be a relationship field and we send the id and the label.
We should have have (fieldId.endsWith('Id') || fieldId === 'providerId' || fieldId === 'modelId'); or such.
We need to think of a better way to manage relationship overall because we will have a lot more entities and relationships in the future. We really want to avoid hardcoded logic and have a generic way to manage this.
Think about this, make your master plan clearly setup and then go on and execute while always making sure what you do is clean and lean.
It's a big and important task for the future of the project and I want to do it step by step. Really take time to think about the best options available to us to do this, consider our project structure and overall already implemented codebase. Then decide in the best one adapted to our project, specifications and requirements. We want resusability, DRY and simple clean code.

We are managing a db with multiple tables right now in our app, to prevent the db.ts file to become too big I want to segment the file into multiple files if possible.
Look at all related file for our db / table management and make sure that we are following best practices in term of coding and architecture so that our app will be easy to maintain and extend.
