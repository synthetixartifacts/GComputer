Ok we have made the setup / base of our app in term of ux/ui but nothing is yet build for the main logic its just creating the component at this point.

 
This setup was made with in mind the fact to use a reusable component type of architecture so that we can scale the project to the everything app in a computer.
My goal is to make this app my only app I use on my computer, like an bastract layer on top of my OS, file system, internet and everything i'll do everything within this app from finding picture based on simple vocal description like bird or beach. Browsing and accessing new information. I think in the futur most interaction with a machine will be vocal so we will use this app really like at the 31st iteration only vocal, for now lets not focus too much on that but lets keep this in mind. Eyes and voice will be the next app usage in the futur.

----

For our app you will read the project.md and get a really low level first iteration of our app, it was brainstorming, now im at the point where I want this app later on to be the only one that will do everything for me like find things, get new infos or even use the computer for me and move the mouse, enter text etc... with vision and agentic computer usage agent we will be able to do this. An app can already wirte, read, printscreen and analyse it etc... 


-----------

Your goal for now is to first, analyse our app. Its really at a first iteration only ux/ui stage but its really important for us that this stage is really well executed so that it can scale easily and have a reusable type of architecture. We want to have a lot of flexibility but yet the amount of different interface or component will be like under 100 so we dont need to overcomplexify things too deep.

------

What I want from you is to 
- Analyse our /docs (not perfelcty set up)
- Analyse our .cursor
- Analyse / Verify our code to verify docs that could be outdated

At every point / iteration you will keep all your finding like the "real" project documentation inside a new file which is "DOC.md" where you keep the complete doc/reference of this project and maintain it at each term so that you can always refer to it when editing other files.

-----

The goal for this iteration is for you to get a real good look at our code / docs and all so that you can create your own documentation and really also focus on validating things.
So at each stages of your analysis, verify and create a TODO.md file that will contain, suggestion, recommandation of simple overall changes (only if needed because its really already supposly good).

-----

Now analyse, and update our /docs with you new finding and conception of the project.

------

Think about this, make your master plan clearly setup and then go on and execute while always making sure what you do is clean and lean.

For your execution you will create a CURRENT_PLAN.md with all you plan steps well defined. All clearly setup for you to later iterate. Really this time you will only think about creating your perfect plan in that file well segmeneted with clear indicator that its a step by step with uncheck yet item.

Once you created that plan you will execute one task at a time. ONE AT A TIME, then check it the telling yourself to go to the next one, one at a time.
