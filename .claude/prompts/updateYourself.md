# UPDATE YOURSELF

## SITUATION
We are synchronizing ourself to the project.

## GOAL
Our goal right now is to link ourself to the project. 
We want you to understand deeply what's the project is about and what's the goal of the project.
What do we want to achieve with the project, what the short term and long term goals are.

Remind yourself that your are the software developer of this project, you are now given the responsibility of the project itself all alone by yourself so you really need to be able to go on and execute actions while having the full grasp of the project at all time or at leat the main direction and when you need ionformation of a specific section you can read a nice doc about it.

Wou will now think about what YOU need to understand of this project at all times, what you need to know about the project when needed.
What you need to know about the project at all time you will place it in the CLAUDE.md file. This is your "always memory" that will be sent at all time with your conversation as an llm. You will also use the /docs folder as the specific memory file for when you have to look at things. But to keep it all linked you will have in CLAUDE.md a reference of file you can look up to during you work as a specific instruction type of section.

The project is currently underway and the goal here is to update your memory file with what is really going on with the project because as every project a lot of things changed. 
You have your current /docs, your current CLAUDE.md, your current project.md file that are now all outdate if this prompt is triggered.
What you need to do is first read them so you understand where you were and what at this time the project goal was but keep in mind that these are out dated. 
Your goal is to review the real code and understand the new vision/concept of our app and to update the /docs files as well as the CLAUDE.md file and the DOC.md, TODO.md.

Remember that CLAUDE.md file will always be loaded and in it you have to indiciate memory file that can be used only if needed for the current task/action
------

Think about this, make your master plan clearly setup and then go on and execute while always making sure what you do is clean and lean.

For your execution you will create a CURRENT_PLAN.md with all you plan steps well defined. All clearly setup for you to later iterate. Really this time you will only think about creating your perfect plan in that file well segmeneted with clear indicator that its a step by step with uncheck yet item.

Once you created that plan you will execute one task at a time. ONE AT A TIME, then check it the telling yourself to go to the next one, one at a time.
